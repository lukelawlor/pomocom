* Pomocom
A simple, fast, and configurable pomodoro timer with multiple interfaces

[[./doc/ncurses_large.png]]

* Interfaces
** ANSI
This interface is displayed with ANSI terminal escape codes. It is the most lightweight interface, but it lacks several features, including:
- colors
- pausing
- skipping sections
  
** ncurses
This interface is displayed with the POSIX library ncurses. It is fully featured!

** wxWidgets
This interface is displayed with the cross-platform GUI library wxWidgets. It's in early development and doesn't support all pomocom settings yet.

* Building & Installation
*pomocom* has the following dependencies:
- C++20
- libncursesw v6.3+ (optional)
- wxWidgets v3.2+ (optional)

*pomocom* can be compiled using the Makefile by running =make= in the project's root directory. To customize the compilation process, you may edit =config.mk=.

Installing *pomocom* will copy the =config= directory in the project's root directory to =~/.config/pomocom= on POSIX systems. To install, run =make install=.

Uninstalling *pomocom* will remove the config directory at =~/.config/pomocom=. To uninstall, run =make uninstall=.

* Configuration
*pomocom* is configured with files found in =~/.config/pomocom=. In there, =pomocom.conf= contains program settings values, and *pomo files* (ending in .pomo) contain timing section information.

** pomocom.conf
=pomocom.conf= is written in the following format:
#+begin_src txt
  setting_name_1 setting_value_1
  setting_name_2 setting_value_2
  setting_name_3 setting_value_3
  ...
#+end_src

Settings come in two distinct types: strings and numbers.

String settings can hold strings with spaces in them, but these spaces must come after the space character after the setting name.

Number settings can be split into multiple subtypes with different byte sizes: bool (1 byte), char (1 byte), int (1 byte), short (2 bytes), and long (8 bytes). These settings can also be set to string values that pomocom converts into numbers using an internal table of *keywords* (ex. you can set the setting =interface= to =ncurses= because =ncurses= is defined as a keyword that translates to the number 1). See the end of this section for a table of all keywords.

Here is an example =pomocom.conf= file:
#+begin_src txt
  interface ncurses
  update_interval 1
  pause_before_section_start true
  breaks_until_long_reset 2
  key.quit q
  key.pause j
  key.section_begin j
  key.section_skip k
  ncurses.color.pomocom.fg blue
  ncurses.color.pomocom.bg default
  ncurses.color.section_work.fg yellow
  ncurses.color.section_work.bg default
  ncurses.color.section_break.fg green
  ncurses.color.section_break.bg default
  ncurses.color.time.fg default
  ncurses.color.time.bg default
#+end_src

You may also configure settings using command line arguments that follow the format =--setting_name=setting_value=. Settings specified in this way are set after =pomocom.conf= is read.

** Pomo Files
Pomo files are written in the following format:
#+begin_src txt
  (name of work section)
  (optional +)(command to run when the section is over)
  (section duration in minutes)m(section duration in seconds)s

  (name of break section)
  (optional +)(command to run when the section is over)
  (section duration in minutes)m(section duration in seconds)s

  (name of long break section)
  (optional +)(command to run when the section is over)
  (section duration in minutes)m(section duration in seconds)s
  
#+end_src

If the section command is prefixed with =+=, the command will be prefixed with the path contained in the setting =paths.bin= (set by default to =~/.config/pomocom/=). This is used so that you can easily execute files in a directory meant for pomocom scripts without needing to add this directory to your =$PATH=.

Here is an example pomo file:
#+begin_src txt
  work time
  +msg.sh snare "work time"
  25m0s

  break time
  +msg.sh square "break time"
  5m0s

  long break time
  +msg.sh square "break time"
  15m0s

#+end_src

* Usage
** Command Line Arguments

*** Picking the Pomo File to Read on Startup
Any argument that doesn't start with =-= is interpreted as the pomo file to read. The path of this file will be the said argument prefixed with the setting =paths.section= (set by default to =~/.config/pomocom/=) and suffixed with =.pomo=. If this argument starts with =./=, the pomo file will be searched for relative to the working directory.

When *pomocom* is run with no specified pomo file, the pomo file =standard.pomo= in the program's config directory is read.

*** Short Arguments
=-q (minutes of work section ) (minutes of break section) (minutes of long break section)=

Stands for quick pomo file setup. This will read the default pomo file and overwrite the lengths of each section.

*** Long Arguments (Settings)
To change settings, pass an argument starting with =--= and ending with the setting name. The next argument should be the value of the setting.

Settings specified in this way will override the settings in =pomocom.conf=.

*** Examples
This will open the pomo file =work.pomo= in the directory contained in the setting =paths.section= and set the setting =interface= to =wx=, regardless of what =interface= is set as in =pomocom.conf=. 
#+begin_src shell
	pomocom work --interface wx
#+end_src

This will open the pomo file =abc.pomo= in the working directory that the command is run from.
#+begin_src shell
	pomocom ./abc
#+end_src

** Default Controls
These are not available in the ANSI interface.

- j :: Begin the timing section, pause, and unpause
- k :: Skip the section
- q :: Quit
