* Pomocom
A simple, fast, and customizable pomodoro timer with multiple interfaces

[[./doc/ncurses.png]]

* Interface Overviews
** ANSI
This interface is displayed with ANSI terminal escape codes. It is the most lightweight interface, but it lacks several features, including:
- colors
- pausing
- skipping sections
  
** Ncurses
This interface is displayed with the POSIX library ncurses. It is fully featured.

* Installation
*pomocom* can be compiled using the Makefile by running =make= in the project's root directory. To customize the compilation process, you may edit =config.mk=.

Installing *pomocom* will copy the =config= directory in the project's root directory to =~/.config/pomocom= on POSIX systems. To install, run =make install=.

Uninstalling *pomocom* will remove the config directory at =~/.config/pomocom=. To uninstall, run =make uninstall=.

* Configuration
*pomocom* is configured with files found in =~/.config/pomocom=. In there, =pomocom.conf= contains program settings values (though it currently isn't read yet), and *pomo files* (ending in .pomo) contain timing section information. pomo files are written in the following format:
#+begin_src
  (name of work section)
  (optional +)(command to run when the section is over)
  (section duration in minutes)m(section duration in seconds)s

  (name of break section)
  (optional +)(command to run when the section is over)
  (section duration in minutes)m(section duration in seconds)s

  (name of long break section)
  (optional +)(command to run when the section is over)
  (section duration in minutes)m(section duration in seconds)s
  
#+end_src

If the section command is prefixed with =+=, the command will be prefixed with the config file path (=~/.config/pomocom/=). This is used so that you can easily execute files in the config directory without needing to add the config file path to your =$PATH=.

Here is an example pomo file:
#+begin_src
  work time
  +msg.sh snare "work time"
  25m0s

  break time
  +msg.sh square "break time"
  5m0s

  long break time
  +msg.sh square "break time"
  15m0s

#+end_src

* Usage

** Command Line Arguments
When *pomocom* is run with no command line arguments, the pomo file =standard.pomo= in the program's config directory is read.

If present, the second command line argument is used to fetch the pomo file to read. The path of this file will be the entirety of the second argument suffixed with =.pomo=.

** Default Controls
These are not available in the ANSI interface.

- j :: Begins the timing section, pauses, and unpauses
- k :: Skips the section
